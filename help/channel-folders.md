# Channel folders

Organizations can sort channels into folders. For example, you can put all
the channels associated with a team into a dedicated folder. Channels will be
grouped into folders in the [left sidebar](/help/left-sidebar) and the
[**Inbox**](/help/inbox) view.

Everyone can [pin channels](/help/pin-a-channel) they personally want to pay
close attention to. Pinned channels appear in a dedicated **pinned channels**
section above channel folders.
