# Channel notifications

You can configure desktop, mobile, and email notifications on a channel by
channel basis.

## Configure notifications for a single channel

These settings will override any default channel notification settings. In [muted
channels](/help/mute-a-channel), channel notification settings apply only to
[unmuted topics](/help/mute-a-topic).
